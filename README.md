JavaScript framework

### Develop provisions in this framework :
#####• Verbose: Variable and method names should be verbose so things are easy to find and understand
#####• Portable: Browsers and console should be catered for
#####• Explicit: Code should be quick to understand Comments: Let’s keep comment noise down. Comments should be succinct.TODO and FIXME are acceptable.
#####• Simple: Keep code simple. Let’s not bore readers!
#####• Indentation: Two spaces
#####• Semicolons: People might want to minify this library — let’s keep simicolons!
#####• Quality: JsLint and reader comments!
#####• Testing: Test first development for both browsers and console
#####• Versioning: GitHub to the rescue
